# weather-dashboard

## I am an avid snowboarder, it seemed only proper that I make something that I can check the weather with!

### Jquery
This is the first time I have ever really put my jquery skills to the test. I really did need to use ever single resource I had to complete this project.
### APIs
I learned how to use apis, get keys, and pull data from the APIS.
### Local storage
The local storage has been a real challange for me. In this project I utulized the search history, and implemented onclick functions embeded into the list items in my Javascript file. It was fun, and time consuming learning how to get that to work.
